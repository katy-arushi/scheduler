# Interview Scheduler

This single page client app has been built with React, and allows users to book, edit, and delete interview appointments. Users can save appointments and view the entire schedule of appointments happening from Monday to Friday.

The app makes requests to an API to fetch and update appointment data from a database.

As with all modern React apps, the Scheduler app features dynamic rendering of components, updating as the state of the data changes.

## Purpose
